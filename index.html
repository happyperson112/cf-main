    <h4> 
    What is Cystic Fibrosis?
    </h4>
  <p class='intro'>  Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic mutation that effects different parts of the body. It effects the lungs and digestive track. There are about 2,000 strains of Cystic Fibrosis. The most common gene is Î”F508, but it is also the most terminal. More than 70,000 people world wide with Cystic Fibrosis. 30,000 of those people are in the US.

    <h4>
      How does Cystic Fibrosis affect people?
    </h4>
    <p class='problems'>
      
    Cystic Fibrosis effects the lungs and the digestive track. It effects the lungs by creating a thick sticky mucus it build up inside and cause breathing problems. It also effects the pancreas and small intestine. Just like in the lungs, mucus builds up inside the pancreas and causes the pancreas to not be able to produce enzymes needed for digestion. In the small intestine, that same mucus lines the organ and prevents important nutrients from being absorbed.
      <br>
      There are lots of symptoms of Cystic Fibrosis, and they depend on the person, but here are some general ones: </div>

   <h4>
     What are the genetic causes of Cystic Fibrosis?
     </h4>
     <p class='family'>
     Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease, so its not contagious. Being genetic means it is spread through families and generations. Having Cystic Fibrosis in your family doesn't mean you automaticity have Cystic Fibrosis. You can be a Carrier. A carrier is a person who has the gene but not the disease. Here is a helpful diagram to help explain more:

      <h4>
        What are treatments for Cystic Fibrosis?
      </h4>
    <p class='treatments'>
      
      Cystic Fibrosis has many different treatments depending on the strand of the disease and the intensity of the gene. Some of the most common treatments are:
 <ul>
   <li> High-Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation- also commonly known as a shaky vest</li>
   <li> Multivitamins</li>
   <li> Antibiotics- could be inhaled, oral, or parenteral</li>
   <li> Pancreatic Enzyme Supplements- to help with digestion</li>
   <li> Bronchodilators- to help open constricted airways to improve breathing </li>
   <li> Mucolytics: increase the lung mucus volume and decrease lung mucus thickness </li>
   <li> Anti-Inflammatories: decrease inflammation in the lungs </li>
     </ul>

     <p3> This is a picture of a vest that might be used for airway clearance. </p3>
     
   <p>  These are just some of the many treatments that people with Cystic Fibrosis use everyday. Many may not take all of these treatments and there are many more, but there is a little over view of what they might be taking. </p>

      How to help the community?
    </h4>
    <p class="hthc">
  <p> 
    You can help the Cystic Fibrosis community by donating. You can donate in a number of different places, but the most general is CFF. CFF is Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, a foundation set up to provide support and research for families with the Cystic Fibrosis gene. You can visit the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation website for some more information.
